# rustaudio
This is a fun project I made to learn Rust and combine it with digital signal processing techniques that I've learned in the past.
Broadly speaking, the scope of this project is to transform and analyze digital audio.

Current audio transformation features are:
- Filtering via convolution
- Filtering via difference equation
- Resampling
- Gain scaling
- Phase shifting

This project can also create spectrogram images from audio inputs.
